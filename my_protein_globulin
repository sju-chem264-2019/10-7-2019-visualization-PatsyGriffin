The globulins are a family of globular proteins that have the higher molecular weights than albumins and are insoluble in pure water but dissolve in dilute salt solutions. Some globulins are produced in the liver, while others are made by the immune system.
The functions of these globulins includes the inhibition of an enzyme that digests protein, an inhibitor of two compounds vital in the clumping (coagulation) of blood, and a protein that can transport the element copper.
What I found to be particularly interesting about Globulin is that it is a protein which is present in many different types of species including humans and even plants. 
To demonstrate the above, I selected the crystal structure of Globulin present in pumpkin.
